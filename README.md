My Content for the Udacity Project Data Science Blog Post as part of the Nanodegree "Data Scientist"

## General
<!-- first line needs to stay here, otherwise the table is not rendered! -->
|  |  | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Description** | A freely selectable data set can be used for this project. The aim is to package the processing of the data in an easily understandable, readable report. |
| **Report** | [Blog](https://einalem1234.github.io/) |
| **Data Set** | The chosen data set for this project is provided by Stackoverflow. It contains the results of a user servey performed in 2017.|

## Why has this project be done and what are the results?
This project is part of the udacity nanodegree *Data Scientist*. The goal was to write an interesting blog post with 3 questions about a freely selectable data set. I chose the *Stackoverflow Survey 2017* data, because the data has already been used in class, so first insight have been gained already.

In this table you find a short summary of the asked questions and their results:

|#| Question | Answer |
| ---| :--- | :---|
|1| Exists a correlation between *Overpaid* and the programming experience? | No, the impression of the respondent if they are over- or underpaid is not strongly influenced by their programming experience.|
|2| Is there a programing language specific correlation between "OtherPeoplesCode - Maintaining other people's code is a form of torture" and "EnjoyDebugging -I enjoy debugging code"? | No clear correlation could be found between *OtherPeoplesCode* and *EnjoyDebugging*. There are language specific changes, but nothing extraordinary. |
|3|How many people, who program in Python, follow the PEP8 guidelines and use spaces instead of tabs?| 50.46 % of all python users in this survey use spaces as it is suggested by the PEP8 pipelines.|


## Getting Started With This Code

## Setup instructions
The following libraries have to be installed to run the notebook:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas 
- seaborn
- sklearn
